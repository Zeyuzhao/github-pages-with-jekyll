# Learning the ways of GitHub

Today, I began learning from a series of courses on GitHub called GitHub Learning Lab. This collection of online, virtual courses guides the student through a variety of tasks on programming and development.

The first course I did, the basic Intro to GitHub, taught me the overall usage of the GitHub. It went through how to start an issue, use basic comments, start a new branch, and other things related to project development.
This course was really helpful, because it guided me through the motions of using the site. The course includes a interactive bot, which provides feedback and instructions on how to proceed. In contrast, traditional tutorials only provided instructions, sometimes on a massive document, which could be quite daunting. 
The bot creates an enviroment as if a live person was teaching me how to use the site.

Kudos to the GitHub Learning Lab team! :cake:
